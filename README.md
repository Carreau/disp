# Disp

Providing default representations of common objects in Python land

![pretty-spark-context](./pretty-context.png)

Works in IPython when the object is the value returned by the last statement of
a cell, or when calling `display()` on it. 

## Install 

```
$ pip install disp
$ ipython -c 'import disp; disp.install()'
ðŸ’– Installation succeeded: enjoy disp ! ðŸ’–
```

## Uninstall

```
$ ipython -c 'import disp; disp.uninstall()'
```

## Supported objects

the following objects will gain superpowers:
